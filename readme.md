Download Wattpad stories for e-book readers, smartphones, desktop and more for free!

This software based on Node.js and Express.js can fetch stories from Wattpad and convert it into an EPUB file or a full functional HTML reader for offline availability.

> ⚠ Important information  
> Due to high user numbers and legal reasons, we had to shut down our official public instance of this project (https://wattpad.ml).  
> But we're not gone! You can quickly set up your own instance with the instructions below.

## Prerequisites and information
**This is a server software and NOT a simple app!**  
It means that this software is meant to be installed on a server by a system administrator and then hooked into a network (for example, the Internet) so that other people can access the website through a browser.  
The Wattpad Downloader is not a program or an app that everyone downloads individually and then simply executes.

However, you can install it for local use on a PC with Windows, Mac or Linux.
For that, you need to install the [Node.js Framework](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Then follow the installation steps below.

If you have set it up properly, your terminal should output the URL that you can open in a web browser.

Why is this all so complicated for end users?
> Because it is a server software meant to be hosted on the internet by system administrators, so others can easily access it over the internet with a browser (like our public instance that we had to shut down. https://wattpad.ml was exactly this software set up on our server).

## Third party instances
These are instances hosted by others, which we list here so that honest users can continue using this software.  
⚠ We are not responsible for these instances and do not provide any guarantee or assume any liability.

## Installation
1. Clone / download the repository
2. Go to the root directory of the project
3. (optional) Make sure to set up the environment variables properly
4. Run `npm install` in your terminal
5. Then run `npm start` in your terminal

### Environment variables
For the node app, to work properly, an .env file with the following values should be created in the project root, or they should be included in the environment variables.
The app will start and work without, but it's recommended to set those variables.

TLDR: All env variables are optional, but for full functionality, we recommend setting them.

```dotenv
# Default port is 2200
PORT = 2200

# Required if the app is running behind a reverse proxy like NGINX
PROXY = true

# Ackee configuration
ACKEE_TRACKER = your_ackee_tracker_script_url
ACKEE_SERVER = your_ackee_url
ACKEE_DOMAIN_ID = your_ackee_domain_id
ACKEE_DETAILED = true

# Rate limiter configuration (duration in seconds)
RATE_LIMIT_POINTS = 5
RATE_LIMIT_DURATION = 86400

# Caching ttl in seconds for the wattpad api
CACHE_TTL = 86400

# Redis connection string (uses NodeCache if not set)
REDIS_URI = redis://192.168.144.128:6379

# Google ReCaptcha configuration
RECAPTCHA_SITEKEY = your_site_key
RECAPTCHA_SECRET = your_captcha_secret
```

## Redis
The Wattpad Downloader works completely without Redis, but it is recommended to have a central redis server running if you are clustering and scaling the software.

## File formats for story conversion

### EPUB
EPUB is an e-book file format that uses the ". epub" file extension.
The term is short for electronic publication and is sometimes styled ePub.
EPUB is supported by many e-readers, and compatible software is available for most smartphones, tablets, and computers.

### HTML
The HTML file features an entire reader including the story (so people can read it offline).
